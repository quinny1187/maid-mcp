# Voice System Fix

## Fixed the Error Message

The voice switching was working but showing an error. I've updated the code to:

1. **Catch the msedge-tts error** - The library has a bug with 'voiceLocale' but voices still change
2. **Provide better feedback** - Now shows voice style and pitch info
3. **Clean response** - No more error messages for successful voice changes

## Voice Descriptions

When you switch voices, you'll now see:
- Voice name and ID
- Language/accent type (Japanese, British, American)
- Style (cute, cheerful, warm, etc.)
- Pitch adjustment info

Example:
```
Voice changed to: ja-JP-NanamiNeural (Nanami) - Japanese accent voice
cute style with +20Hz pitch adjustment
```

## Available Voices

### Japanese Voices (for authentic maid accent)
- **Nanami** - Cute style, highest pitch (+20Hz) - Default
- **Mayu** - Gentle style, medium pitch (+15Hz)
- **Aoi** - Energetic style, lower pitch (+10Hz)

### English Voices
- **Jenny** - American, cheerful style
- **Aria** - American, warm style  
- **Maisie** - British, young style (+5Hz pitch)

The error handling now works properly - after restart, voice switching will give clean, informative responses!
