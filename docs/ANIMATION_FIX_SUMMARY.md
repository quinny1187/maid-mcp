# Animation System Fix Summary

## Problem
- Animations weren't being cancelled when using `set_avatar_pose`
- The issue was that sending `animation: null` through axios wasn't working properly

## Solution
Changed approach to use the DELETE /animate endpoint:

1. **Added `stop_animation` tool** - Explicitly stops any running animation
2. **Updated `set_avatar_pose`** - Now calls DELETE /animate before setting pose
3. **Updated `hide_avatar`** - Also stops animations when hiding

## How It Works Now

### Starting Animation
```javascript
maid:animate_avatar({
  sequence: "search_1,search_2,search_3",
  fps: 2,
  loop: true
})
```

### Stopping Animation
Any of these will now properly stop animations:
- `maid:set_avatar_pose({ pose: "love" })` - Stops animation then sets pose
- `maid:stop_animation()` - Just stops the animation
- `maid:hide_avatar()` - Stops animation and hides
- Left-click on avatar (without dragging)

## Technical Details
- The Flask server has a DELETE /animate endpoint that clears animation and sets pose to idle
- This is more reliable than trying to send null values through JSON
- All pose changes now properly cancel animations first

## Testing
After restarting the MCP server:
1. Start a looping animation
2. Use set_avatar_pose to change pose
3. Animation should stop and new pose should display
